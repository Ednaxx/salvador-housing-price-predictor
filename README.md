# Salvador Housing Price Predictor

## A Machine Learning API for prediction of housing prices in Salvador/Bahia üìà.

This is an educational personal project for Web Scraping and Machine Learning. All data was scraped from the [VivaReal](https://www.vivareal.com.br) website.

## Installation:

### 1. Set virtual environment

Set a Python Virtual Environment. You may use ```python3 -m venv .venv``` on your terminal inside the project folder or any other method you prefer. 

With your venv created, activate it with ```source .venv/bin/activate```.

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

### 3. Run API

To run the server locally, run ```uvicorn app:app``` on the terminal.

And voila, the server will be running on ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` and you can check the docs on ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs```.

To run the scripts independently (such as "load_data_pipeline.py"), use ```python3 -m src.<path>.<to>.<script>```
